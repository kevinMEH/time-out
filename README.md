## Features

- Unobstructive Blocking
- Fully Customizable
- Tasks List
- Completely Free
- No Data Collection

### Non Obstructive Blocking

Time Out strives to be as unobstructive as possible. Unlike other site blocking extensions, Time Out does not interfere with your workflow.

For example, lets say that you are a programmer and you want to stop watching cat videos on YouTube.

With other site blocking extensions, if you add YouTube to it's filter list, it would block out YouTube completely, even if you're trying to watch a YouTube video on something needed for your work, for example a tutorial on how to use this new framework. With other site blockers, you will have to disable the extension or remove YouTube from the list, thus wasting time and creating the problem that you might forget to turn the extension back on.

With Time Out however, you can unblock any site with just the click of a button. Time Out serves as a way to remind you on what you should be doing, not to waste your time enabling and disabling the extension as you go.

After all, Time Out was designed to help you manage your time!

### Fully Customizable

With Time Out, you can customize your block screen to your liking.

Instead of just a plain blank screen telling you to go back to work, you can choose a background image, customize the title text, and more.

### Tasks List

With Time Out, you can add a custom tasks list to Time Out which displays on the block page.

You can add a description to the task along with a redirect link so you can quickly navigate to unfinished work on the blocked page.

### Completely Free

Time Out is completely free and open source. There's no restrictions to how many sites you can add, or restrictions on any of Time Out's features. Go crazy.

### No Data Collection

Time Out does not collect any data of any kind. Time Out is also open source, so feel free to verify this for yourselves.

## FAQ

### How Can I Help?

[Please check the TODO list here.](TODO.md)

Since this extension is free and I'm a student, I will be very busy at times and I may not update the extension. You can try making a pull request adding features or fixing bugs to help out!

One of the key ways you can help out is migrating the extension from Chrome's Manifest v2 to Manifest v3. The process should be fairly simple for most parts, however for the actual site blocking, [you will have to use the new declarativeNetRequest API.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/)
